## üåü Running the Project on Google Colab

To run the project on Google Colab:

1. Create a new Colab notebook
2. Add this code to install dependencies (only pygame is required for text-only mode):
   ```python
   !pip install pygame
   ```
   
   If you want to run with Kivy visual elements (optional):
   ```python
   !pip install pygame kivy
   ```

3. Upload all code files using this helper:
   ```python
   from google.colab import files
   import os

   # Create a function to receive uploaded files
   def upload_files():
       uploaded = files.upload()
       print("Files uploaded successfully!")
       return list(uploaded.keys())

   # Run this function to upload files
   upload_files()
   ```

4. Run the program with the text-only version (works in all environments):
   ```python
   !python text_only_experience.py
   ```

   Or try running with visual elements (may require extra configuration):
   ```python
   !python austen_experience.py
   ```

## üé® Customizing Themes

story, elements = generator.generate_story("unexpected inheritance", complexity_level=2)

# Print the story
print(story)
```

### Getting a Thematic Quote

```python
from austen_quotes import AustenQuoteGenerator

# Create the quote generator
quote_generator = AustenQuoteGenerator()

# Get a quote by theme
